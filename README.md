# 🌐 Landscape Web Design Assignment

A modern, responsive, multi-page website built using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. This project features a unique landscape-oriented layout with a focus on Glassmorphism and parallel content alignment.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project was designed as a "Creative Developer" portfolio for a web development subject. It emphasizes a wide-screen (landscape) user experience, utilizing a blurred "glass" aesthetic over a professional coding background.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Landscape Layout:** Designed with a `90vw` width and `85vh` height to maintain a cinematic feel.
* **Parallel Content:** Uses **CSS Flexbox** to align profile text and a user image side-by-side.
* **CSS-Only Pop-up:** A functional modal/pop-up on the Home page created using the `:target` pseudo-class (zero JavaScript).
* **Multimedia Integration:** A live YouTube video embed on the Projects page.
* **Interactive UI:** Smooth hover effects, scaling transitions, and styled form inputs.
* **Glassmorphism:** Semi-transparent containers with `backdrop-filter: blur()`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The project is organized into the following files:
* `index.html` - The home page featuring the parallel layout and pop-up.
* `about.html` - Professional biography and skill cards.
* `projects.html` - Work showcase with YouTube video integration.

## 💡 Concepts Learned
During this assignment, I focused on:
1.  **Box Model Mastery:** Using `box-sizing: border-box` to ensure padding and borders don't break the landscape dimensions.
2.  **Responsive Units:** Utilizing `vw` (viewport width) and `vh` (viewport height) for fluid scaling.
3.  **Flexbox:** Mastering horizontal and vertical alignment of elements.
4.  **Iframe Security:** Learning the difference between standard YouTube links and the `/embed/` format.
